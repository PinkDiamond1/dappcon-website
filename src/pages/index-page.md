aboutDappcon: >-
  DappCon is a nonprofit global developer conference focusing on decentralized
  applications, tooling, and foundational infrastructure on Ethereum. Last year
  DappCon 2018 brought together more than 600 Ethereum developers, researchers
  and enthusiasts. We’re giving it another go this summer and encourage anyone
  interested in the ecosystem or networking with dapp developers to attend.
  We’ll be working closely with
  [EthBerlin](https://ethberlinzwei.com/index.html) to make sure your Berlin
  Blockchain week is a success!

aboutGnosis: >-
  DappCon is organized by [Gnosis](https://gnosis.pm), one of Ethereum’s early
  dapps. Gnosis launched in August 2015, one week after Frontier went live, as
  the first major dapp on Ethereum. Today, we are building four Ethereum-based
  dapps and are working towards the development and continuous growth of
  Ethereum—both its infrastructure and the ecosystem.
