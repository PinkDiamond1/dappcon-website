aboutDappcon: >-
  DappCon is a nonprofit global developer conference, organized by [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io), an Ethereum based company building prediction markets, decentralized exchanges and a multi-signature wallet. 
  The conference focuses on decentralized applications, tooling, and foundational infrastructure on Ethereum. Last year [DappCon 2018](https://2018.dappcon.io) brought together more than 600 Ethereum developers, researchers and enthusiasts. We’re giving it another go this summer and encourage anyone interested in the ecosystem or networking with dapp developers to attend. We’ll be working closely with
  [EthBerlin](https://ethberlinzwei.com/index.html) to make sure your [Berlin
  Blockchain week](https://blockchainweek.berlin/calendar/) is a success!
