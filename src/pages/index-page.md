aboutGnosis: >-
  DappCon is organized by Gnosis, one of Ethereum’s early dApps. Gnosis launched
  in August 2015, one week after Frontier went live, as the first major dapp on
  Ethereum. Today, Gnosis is building four major Ethereum-based dapps and works
  towards the development and continuous growth of Ethereum—both its
  infrastructure and ecosystem.
